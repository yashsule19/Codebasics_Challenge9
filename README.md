# Codebasics_Challenge9
The following project was created for the Challenge # 9 conducted by Codebasics.
- **Title**: Analyse Promotions and Provide Tangible Insights to Sales Director.

# Introduction
## Company Background
- AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products.

## Agenda
- The sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.

## Problem
- Sales director Bruce Haryali wanted this immediately but the analytics manager Tony is engaged on another critical project.

## Decision
- Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious data analyst of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Tony also provided some notes to Peter to support his work.

## Challenge given
My role was to act as Peter Pandey and perform the following task to keep up the trust with my manager Tony Sharma. 
- Go through the metadata and analyze the datasets thoroughly.
- Check “Recommended Insights.pdf” – this document contains a few recommendations from your manager Tony.
- Check “ad-hoc-requests.pdf” - this document includes important business questions posed by senior executives, requiring SQL-based report generation.
- Design a dashboard with your metrics and analysis. The dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.

## About Data Tables
- 4 Tables (3 dimension tables and 1 fact table): The following tables were available in csv format.

| Table name and Size | Description |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| dim_campaigns - **(2 rows, 4 columns)** | Campaigns information |
| dim_products - **(15 rows, 3 columns)** | Products information |
| dim_stores - **(50 rows, 2 columns)** | Stores information |
| fact_events - **(1500 rows, 7 columns)** | Information regarding Sales / Promotions Events |

Along with it, there was a database file that contains all of these data tables for analyses by exectuing SQL query statements. 

## Tools
